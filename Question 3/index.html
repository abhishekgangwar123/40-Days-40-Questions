<!-- Question 3: What is the Difference between HTML And XHTML?

Answer : 

HTML : Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML) is a programming language that shows information and depicts a site page's design. 
       Hypertext works with perusing the web by referring to an HTML page's hyperlinks. 
       The hyperlink empowers one to go to any put on the web by clicking it. There is no set request to do as such.
       HTML is a programming language used to make sites that anybody with web access can see. 
       The labels are the words between the < angle brackets > and separate standard content from HTML code. 
       These are shown on website pages as pictures, tables, outlines, etc.


Example : -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1> Hello World </h1>  
    <p> welcome this is your first HTML program </p>  
  
</body>
