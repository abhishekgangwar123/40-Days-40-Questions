XHTML : XHTML stands for extensible hypertext markup language which is a connection between HTML (hypertext mark-up language) and XML (extensible markup language) also at most of the places XHTML is considered superior than HTML.
        XHTML is easy to use with other data formats, and it creates more neat code as it is stricter than HTML. 
        Therefore, it is more compatible with most browsers, and it maintains a standard of code that can be used for various devices.
