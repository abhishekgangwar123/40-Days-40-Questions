<!-- Question 2 : WHat is AJAX?

Answer : AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML,
CSS, and Java Script.
AJAX uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content
display.
AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software.
With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the
current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="demo">
        <h1> AJAX </h1>
        <button type="button" onclick="loadDoc()">Change Content</button>
    </div>

    <script>
        function loadDoc() {
            var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
            xhttp.onreadystatechange = function () {
                if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
                    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
                        this.responseText;
                }
            };
            xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
            xhttp.send();
        }
    </script>
</body>
