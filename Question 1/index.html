Question 1 : What is CDN ?

Answer : A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users.
         A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.


Example :

CDNs cache content like web pages, images, and video in proxy servers near to your physical location. 
This allows you to do things like watch a movie, download software, check your bank balance, post on social media, or make purchases, without having to wait for content to load. 
You could think of a CDN like an ATM.
